# Ethical Use Guidelines

## Responsible Security Testing

BRS-GPT is a professional cybersecurity tool designed for **authorized security testing only**. Users must follow ethical guidelines and responsible disclosure practices.

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Authorization First
- **Always obtain explicit written permission** before testing any system
- Ensure you have legal authority to perform security assessments
- Verify scope and boundaries of authorized testing
- Maintain documentation of authorization

### 2. Do No Harm
- Never cause damage, disruption, or data loss
- Respect system availability and performance
- Avoid testing during critical business hours without permission
- Use minimal necessary testing to achieve objectives

### 3. Responsible Disclosure
- Report vulnerabilities to system owners promptly
- Allow reasonable time for remediation before public disclosure
- Follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices
- Protect sensitive information discovered during testing

### 4. Professional Conduct
- Maintain confidentiality of client information
- Use findings only for authorized security improvement purposes
- Respect intellectual property and proprietary information
- Follow industry best practices and standards

## Authorized Use Cases

### ✅ Legitimate Uses
- **Penetration Testing** with proper contracts and authorization
- **Bug Bounty Programs** within program scope and rules
- **Security Audits** for organizations you work for or have contracts with
- **Research** on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- **Educational** purposes on dedicated training environments
- **Compliance Testing** as part of regulatory requirements

### ❌ Prohibited Uses
- Testing systems without explicit permission
- Malicious attacks or unauthorized access attempts
- Violating computer crime laws in any jurisdiction
- Testing outside authorized scope or timeframes
- Using findings for illegal activities
- Bypassing security controls for unauthorized access

## AI Ethics Considerations

### Responsible AI Use
- AI analysis results should be validated by human experts
- AI recommendations are advisory and require human judgment
- Consider AI bias and limitations in security assessments
- Maintain human oversight of AI-driven decisions

### Data Privacy
- AI analysis may involve sending technical data to OpenAI
- Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations
- Avoid sending sensitive or personal information to AI services
- Review OpenAI's data usage policies

## Best Practices

### Before Testing
1. Obtain written authorization with clear scope
2. Understand legal requirements in your jurisdiction
3. Plan testing to minimize impact on systems
4. Establish communication channels with system owners
5. Prepare incident response procedures

### During Testing
1. Stay within authorized scope and timeframes
2. Monitor system impact and adjust testing accordingly
3. Document all activities and findings
4. Stop testing if unexpected issues arise
5. Maintain professional communication

### After Testing
1. Report findings promptly and professionally
2. Provide clear remediation guidance
3. Respect agreed-upon disclosure timelines
4. Securely delete or archive scan data as appropriate
5. Follow up on remediation progress if requested

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Responsible Disclosure Process
1. **Discovery** - Identify potential security issue
2. **Verification** - Confirm vulnerability exists and assess impact
3. **Documentation** - Create detailed technical report
4. **Notification** - Contact system owner through appropriate channels
5. **Coordination** - Work with owner on remediation timeline
6. **Disclosure** - Public disclosure after reasonable remediation time

### Disclosure Timeline
- **Immediate** - Critical vulnerabilities actively exploited
- **30 days** - High severity vulnerabilities
- **90 days** - Medium severity vulnerabilities
- **180 days** - Low severity vulnerabilities

## Legal Compliance

### International Considerations
- Computer crime laws vary by jurisdiction
- Ensure compliance with laws in your location and target location
- Consider cross-border legal implications
- Consult legal counsel when in doubt

### Industry Standards
- Follow OWASP Testing Guide principles
- Adhere to NIST Cybersecurity Framework guidelines
- Comply with industry-specific regulations
- Maintain professional certifications and training
