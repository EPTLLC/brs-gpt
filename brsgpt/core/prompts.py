# AI Planning Prompt
PLANNING_PROMPT = """
You are an elite cybersecurity AI planning engine. Analyze the target and create an intelligent attack plan.

Target: {target}

Create a smart, efficient security assessment plan that prioritizes high-impact areas:

1. **Target Intelligence**: What type of system/application is this likely to be?
2. **Attack Surface Priority**: Which areas should we focus on first for maximum impact?
3. **Smart Recon Strategy**: What specific reconnaissance should we do (avoid wasting time)?
4. **Vulnerability Priorities**: What types of vulnerabilities are most likely based on target analysis?
5. **Time Optimization**: How can we get 80% of results in 20% of time?

    "risk_profile": "high/medium/low",
    "priority_areas": [

            "expected_findings": "description"
        }}

        "subdomain_limit": number,
        "port_scan_focus": ["specific ports"],
        "technology_focus": ["specific technologies"],
        "skip_areas": ["areas to skip for efficiency"]
    }},
    "vulnerability_strategy": {{
        "xss_contexts": ["most_likely_contexts"],
        "payload_focus": ["most_effective_payloads"],
        "skip_patterns": ["patterns to skip"]

        "xss_minutes": number,
        "analysis_minutes": number,
        "total_target_minutes": number
    }}
}}

Focus on SPEED and EFFICIENCY. We want maximum security insights in minimum time.
"""

# Live Analysis Prompt
LIVE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are a real-time cybersecurity analysis AI. Analyze these findings as they come in and provide immediate insights.

Current Findings:
{findings}

Provide immediate analysis:
1. **Critical Discoveries**: What's most important right now?
2. **Attack Vectors**: What attack paths are immediately apparent?
3. **Next Actions**: What should we prioritize next based on these findings?
4. **Risk Level**: Current risk assessment
5. **Time Savings**: Can we skip anything based on these findings?

Format as JSON:
{{
    "critical_findings": [list of most critical discoveries],
    "immediate_risks": [list of immediate security risks],
    "attack_vectors": [list of potential attack paths],
    "next_priorities": [what to focus on next],
    "optimization_suggestions": [how to save time],
    "current_risk_score": number_1_to_10,
    "confidence_level": "high/medium/low"
}}

Be fast, decisive, and actionable. This is real-time analysis.
