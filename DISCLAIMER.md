# Disclaimer

## Important Notice

BRS-GPT is a **professional cybersecurity tool** designed for experienced security practitioners. This software is provided for **authorized security testing only**.

## No Warranty

BRS-GPT is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to:

- Merchantability
- Fitness for a particular purpose
- Non-infringement
- Accuracy of results
- Completeness of analysis

## Limitation of Liability

## User Responsibility

### Authorization Required
- Users are **solely responsible** for ensuring they have proper authorization
- Testing without permission may violate laws and regulations
- Users assume all legal risks associated with use

### Professional Use Only
- This tool requires cybersecurity expertise to use effectively
- Results require professional interpretation and validation
- Not suitable for non-technical users or automated decision-making

### AI Limitations
- AI analysis is for **correlation and reporting** - not primary vulnerability detection
- Most vulnerability detection uses deterministic scanning techniques
- AI provides context analysis and prioritization - results require human validation
- AI may produce false positives or miss certain contextual relationships
- AI recommendations should be reviewed by security experts
- OpenAI API costs ($0.02-$0.15 per scan) are the user's responsibility

## Legal Compliance

### User Obligations
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
- Obtain proper authorization before testing
- Respect terms of service and acceptable use policies
- Maintain appropriate insurance and legal protections

### Jurisdiction
- This disclaimer is governed by applicable laws
- Users are responsible for compliance in their jurisdiction
- Legal disputes subject to appropriate legal forums

## Technical Disclaimers

### Accuracy
- Security scan results may contain false positives or false negatives
- Vulnerability detection uses proven scanning techniques (SQLi, SSRF, XXE, XSS)
- AI correlation is based on available data and may be incomplete
- Manual verification of all findings is strongly recommended
- Results are point-in-time assessments only

### Performance
- Scanning performance depends on network conditions and target responsiveness
- AI response times depend on OpenAI service availability
- Tool may not work correctly with all target configurations
- Resource usage varies based on scan scope and AI model selection

### Compatibility
- Tested on supported Python versions and platforms
- May not work correctly in all environments
- Dependencies may have their own limitations and requirements
- AI models may be updated or deprecated by OpenAI

## Third-Party Services

### OpenAI Integration
- BRS-GPT uses OpenAI services for AI correlation and reporting (not primary scanning)
- Default models: gpt-5-mini, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-5-nano for minimal costs
- Users subject to OpenAI's terms of service and privacy policy
- OpenAI usage costs ($0.02-$0.15 per scan) are the user's responsibility
- Service availability depends on OpenAI infrastructure
- AI analysis can be disabled - core scanning still functions

### External Dependencies
- Tool relies on third-party Python packages
- Dependencies may have their own licenses and limitations
- Security and reliability of dependencies not guaranteed
- Users responsible for keeping dependencies updated

## Data and Privacy

### Local Data Storage
- Scan results stored locally on user's system
- Users responsible for securing scan data
- No data transmitted to EasyProTech LLC servers
- API communications with OpenAI follow their privacy policy

### Sensitive Information
- Tool may discover sensitive information during scans
- Users responsible for handling discovered data appropriately
- Comply with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Implement appropriate data retention and deletion policies

## Support Limitations

### No Support Policy
- **NO SUPPORT PROVIDED** for open-source users
- Community support available through GitHub issues only
- Commercial support available with paid licensing
- Users expected to have cybersecurity expertise

### Updates and Maintenance
- Software provided without guarantee of updates or bug fixes
- Users responsible for monitoring security advisories
- Commercial users may receive priority updates and patches
- Open-source users use software at their own risk
